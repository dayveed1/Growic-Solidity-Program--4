// Enums.
/**
 * Enums are used to create user-defined data types, used to assign a name to an integral constant which makes the contract 
 * more readable, maintainable, and less prone to errors. Options of enums can be represented by unsigned integer values 
 * starting from 0. e.g. enum ActionChoices { GoLeft, GoRight, GoStraight, SitStill }

// Bytes.
/**
 * Although bytes are similar to strings, there are some differences between them. bytes are used to store a fixed-sized 
 * character set while the string is used to store the character set equal to or more than a byte. The length of bytes 
 * is from 1 to 32, while the string has a dynamic length. Byte has the advantage that it uses less gas, so better to use 
 * when we know the length of data. e,g. bytes1 a = 0xb5; //  [10110101]
